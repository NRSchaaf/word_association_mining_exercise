## Word Association Mining Exercise

In this exercise, we will explore basic word association mining techniques. The example corpus contains 180 movie reviews, each written by one of two reviewers: the first 80 by Berardinelli and the remaining 100 by Schwartz.

## LDA Topic Modeling Exercise

In this exercise we apply LDA topic modeling on the entire corpus and extract k=10 topics, list the top 10 words for each topic, then list the topic coveraqge probabilitiesfor each document in the corpus.
